# AE5 Flask Helper

Anaconda Enterprise 5 simplifies the deployment of web applications
utilizing frameworks such as Flask. However, developing such apps
within AE5 can be a bit challenging because of the need to view the
application in development through a special proxy URL. Specifically,
the application will be visible at the URL
```
https://<session-id>.<ae5-domain-name>/proxy/8086/
```
where `<session-id>` is the UUID of the session and
`<ae5-domain-name>` of the AE5 cluster. Unfortunately, Flask does not
naturally adapt to the use of the `/proxy/8086` prefix and as a result
rendering of some pages, particularly with static content, is faulty,
_even though_ the application is otherwise properly designed and will
render perfectly in production.

This package provides a simple correction by patching the Flask `url_for`
function to prepend `/proxy/8086` to all generated URLs. As long as
the Flask developer uses the `url_for` command for every internal URL
generated by the application, this will produce the correct results
during development. The package is designed _not_ to apply this patch
in production, which means deployed Flask apps are unaffected.
